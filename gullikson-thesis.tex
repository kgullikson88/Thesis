\chapter{Detection of Low-Mass-ratio Stellar Binary Systems}
This chapter was previously published \citep{Gullikson2013_2}. The co-author, Sarah Dodson-Robinson, was my advisor at the time and provided much of the idea for the project.

\chapter{Future Direct Spectroscopic Detection of Hot Jupiters with IGRINS}
This chapter was previously published \citep{Gullikson2013}. The co-author, Mike Endl, was my co-supervisor at the time and provided much of the inspiration for the work as well as a great deal of technical assistance.

\include{paper2}

\chapter{Correcting for Telluric Absorption: Methods, Case Studies, and Release of the TelFit Code}
This chapter was previously published \citep{Gullikson2014}. Both co-authors were my advisor at some point while I was developing this code. They helped guide the code requirements and provided a science case study for the work. Adam Kraus provided observational data for the case study.
